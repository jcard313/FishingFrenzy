How To Play:

To play the game you must avoid the trash (cans), while collecting difference species of fish. If you hit the trash, its game over for you. 
Collect different abilities as you descend to aid you in your quest to reach new high scores. There are two abilities you can obtain: 
invincibility and double points. These can have monumental impacts on your success, so be sure to collect them when possible. The game speeds
up as time passes, so be prepared to react quickly! You can see your current depth in the top left-hand corner of the screen, along with your
score and your highscore.

When at the main menu you can change the difficulty if you enjoy a good challenge. This makes the game run much faster, meaning you have to 
be even quicker to avoid the obstacles! You can also adjust your settings to increase or decrease the music and sound effects volume. Cosmetic
changes can also be selected by heading to the cosmetics page. Here yuou can select different looking hooks to spice up your experience.

Alright, thats all. Have fun! :)
